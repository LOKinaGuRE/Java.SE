//main method should be void always
//java.lang.* importing features
//static : we can method without creating object of class
//main method should be always public 
//class we can declare non-public also
//but for needing to access to run the java file easily we need to declare Main method Class as public
//Anything in java exectues should be inside Class only
//System.out.println ()---> Classname.ObjectName.methodName 
//String args[] is parameters for passing arguments to java --> This is compulsory

// JavaC is a java compiler : Compiles .Java  file and ByteCode File will be generated
// Java Filename >>> is a JVM interprets the ByteCode File (.Class File) into machine code and
// machine code is executed by system :

//	JVM < JRE < JDK
