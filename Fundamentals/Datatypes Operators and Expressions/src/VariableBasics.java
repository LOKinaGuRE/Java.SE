	/* What are Variables ?
	well Varible : is Place that holdes data  in a any programming language 
	By using variable name , we'll access the data which we've given or mentioned
	
	There are 2 types of Datatypes
	1.Primitive and 2.Non-primitive(By using primitive types)
	while using varible we need to mention of What type of data this is storing
	if it holding an integer means , We should Declare ---> int
	
	int 		varible_1 ;  ----< This  is Declaration of Varible
	Datatyppe	varible_name  <---- Sample
	
	float flotingVarible_2 ;
	*/
	
	int variable$1;
		variable$1 = 51 ; // <--- Intitialisation  (giving a value in it)

	/* Rules for declaring variable :
		1--> Don't use Java Keywords
		2--> we can use alphabates , Numbers , _(underscore) , $ (doller) No other symbols
		3--> varible name shouldn't be start with numbers (it can start with _ or $ )
		4--> Don't use active classnames as var names
		5--> Varibles are CaseSensitive( "var" is differ from  "VAR" )

		6--> not grammer but DevStanderds <--- nomenclature style in camelCase ( varName)
		7--> use relevant names for Better Understanding (length of Var has no limitations , But use as per need > Dont use lenghty names)
	*/

		
		System.out.println(variable$1);
