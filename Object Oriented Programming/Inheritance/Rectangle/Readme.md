In Previous example classes ,
we didn't utilise the facility of constructor and
constructor overloading

Constructor is a method which have same name as class which can take parameter but,
will not(shouldn't) return any value.

In previous examples, for set values we used the setter method after initialising the constructor

Scanner sc = new Scanner (System.in);   :--> Parameterised constructor
Circle  c1 = new Circle ();             :--> non-parameterised constructor

we need to call constructor explicitly, If we don't than default constructor will be accessed
